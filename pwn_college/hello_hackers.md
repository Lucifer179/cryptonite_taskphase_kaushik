# Intro to Commands and Arguments

I hadn't really understood what exactly it was asking of me initially cause I thought it meant I have to somehow get the terminal to give me an output of "hello" when I type something in and then realized that it literally just wants me to enter a command 'hello' lol.
Similar train of thought with intro to arguments. Got that it was asking me to recognize 'hello' as the command and 'hackers' as its argument.

## Challenge

"You will find the flag after decrypting this file"

Since the name of the challenge is rotation, I figured it has t be encrypted in rotation cipher.

## Solve

After googling rotation cipher, I found Caesar Cipher to be an example and realized that they're the same as shift cipher. I looked up an online Caesar cipher decoder, bruteforced it and got the flag.

## Flag
`picoCTF{r0tat1on_d3crypt3d_429af00f}`

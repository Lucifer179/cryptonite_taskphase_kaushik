## Challenge

"What do the flags mean?"

## Solve

Immediately I knew that the flags were in `picoCTF{` format so I knew which flags corresponded to which letter for those but there were naturally other letters involved. I tried looking to see if there was any pattern with which those letters were chosen for those flags (whether the flag resembles the letter in any way and such) but couldn't find any.

I then googled the flags and found that they were International Maritime Signal flags. I compared the flags and got the flag.

- Cryptography alone is not sufficient for secure communication but it is an important first step.

Primary functions of cryptography -

1. Privacy - Only intended receiver can read the message sent. 
2. Authentication - Process of proving one's identity.
3. Integrity - Assuring message received by user isn't altered from the original.
4. Non-repudiation - Proving that the sender really sent the message.
5. Key exchange - Sharing crypto keys between sender and receiver.

Some terms in cryptography -

- Forward Secrecy: Protecting past encrypted sessions by creating a different key for each session so that compromise of one key doesn't jeopardize the rest of them.
- Perfect Security: An unbreakable system where the message contains no information about the plaintext or key. To achieve this, the key has to be at least as long as the plaintext. Ex - OTPs (one time pads).
- Deniable Authentication: Method by which participants of an exchange can plausibly deny ever sending/receiving a specific message to a third party, even if they actually did.
